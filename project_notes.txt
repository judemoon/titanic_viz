I had a question whether I should keep html, css, js files separately or all together. Separating is recommented for standards model due to efficiency, mainatenance, accessibility, device compatibility, and web search engines. However, I found html file for data visualization is better to combine css and js all together becuase I will use the source code to post on my blog so I can easily copy and paste the codes. So I decided to keep them together for this project

Understood the structure of html code with js
- load d3
- style
- script with function and variable
- svg container
- load data

Create summary table and save as .csv

Change bar color
chart.defaultColors = [
          new dimple.color("#F6CEF5"), #baby pink
          new dimple.color("#81DAF5"), #sky blue
        ];
